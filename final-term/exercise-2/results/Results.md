### Summary

HIGH CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT : YES

SMALL WORLD : YES

POWER LAW : NO

## Theoretical properties

### randomG

This model tends to create a network with a low clustering coefficient, with a diameter of order of log (n) (therefore
not SMALL WORLD) and usually in these graphs the nodes have almost all the same degree.

HIGH CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT : NO

SMALL WORLD : NO (IT DEPENDS ON THE PROBABILITY USED, WITH P=0.005 THE DIAMETER è 4, WITH P=0.20 è 2)

POWER LAW : NO

From a theoretical point of view, this model can be excluded, because it does not reflect the network features.

### configurationG

This model is an extension of the probabilistic model, but it imposes on the generated network the node degree
distribution passed as input. Therefore, if for example a degree sequence from a power law is passed to it, then the
outgoing network will present a node degree distribution that reflects it.

In general this model has these features:

HIGH CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT : NO

SMALL WORLD : NO

POWER LAW : DEPENDS ON THE DEGREE SEQUENCE PASSSED AS INPUT

From a theoretical point of view, this model can be excluded, because it does not reflect the network features.

### preferentialG

Questo modello tende a generare dei grafi la cui distribuzione dei gradi dei nodi rispecchia una power law. Inoltre di
solito le reti generate con questo modello non sono degli small world e non hanno alto indice di clusterizzazione.

This model tends to generate graphs whose node degree distribution reflects a power law. Furthermore, usually the
networks generated with this model are not small worlds and do not have a high clustering index.

In general this model has these features:

HIGH CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT : NO

SMALL WORLD : NO

POWER LAW : YES

Based on the theoretical considerations we can exclude this model, as the networks generated by it impose a node degree
distribution which is a power_law, while our network does not reflect this property. Furthermore it generally does not
return a network that is a small world and with a high clustering index both of which are true for the network under
consideration.

### Generalized Watts-Strogatz

This model usually generates networks that are a small world, which have high clustering index if nodes are adequately
arranged in space, but the node degree distribution does not usually reflect a power law.

HIGH CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT : DEPENDS ON HOW NODES ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE FEATURE SPACE

SMALL WORLD : YES

POWER LAW : NO

Based on the theoretical considerations, this model is the best candidate because it reflects all the feature presented
by the network under consideration.

### affiliationG

This model has several input parameters, and is therefore difficult to use, but if the parameters are chosen adequately,
it presents the following features:

HIGH CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT: YES

SMALL WORLD : YES

POWER LAW : YES

Based on the theoretical considerations, this model could be excluded for the power law degree distribution it imposes
on the network generated.

## Experimental results

All the experiments were performed by comparing the following value with the network under consideration:

1) Average of the degrees of the nodes.
2) Standard deviation of the degrees of the nodes.
3) Graph degree->number of nodes, for an in-depth analysis of the node degree distribution.
4) Network diameter.
5) Clustering coefficient.

### randomG
Several experiments were carried out varying the parameter p of the model:

| p     | Considerations  |      
| ---- | ---- |
| (5e-05 - 0.0005) |  The mean and standard deviation of degrees tends to be very low (the graph is also unconnected so the diameter is infinite) moreover, the clustering coefficient is very low as expected.|      
| 0.005     |  The mean and standard deviation of the degrees tend to values comparable to those of the network in exam, 50 as average and 7 as std, even if still far from ours (77 and 12), the diameter is small 4 so the network is a Small world, but the clustering coefficient is very very low 0.005034 two orders of magnitude lower than those of the network in question.    |      
| (0.05 - 0.2)   |  The mean and the standard deviation of the degrees explode, the diameter is 2 this implies that the network is very connected, but the clustering coefficient remains much lower than that of the network under consideration.    |


For all the values of p, the degree distribution of the nodes seems to respect a Gaussian distribution with means and variances
different from each other and that strongly depend on the parameter p.

Comparison between the node degree distribution of the network under examination and that of the randomG model with p = 0.005

These experimental results reflect the theoretical analysis previously carried out, confirming the exclusion of
this model. In particular, the main differences between the network in exam and the ones generated using this model is
the clustering index and the node degree distribution.

### preferentialG
Several experiments were carried out varying the parameter p of the model:

|  p    |   degree mean   | degree std |  diameter | clustering coefficient|
| ---- | ---- |---- |---- |---- |
|   0.2   |   2  | 1.1343 | None | 0 |
|   0.4   |   1.99   | 1.334 | None | 0 |
|   0.6   |   2   | 1.7093 | None | 0 |
|   0.8   |   2   | 2.4980 | None | 0 |

All the network generated using this model presented a power law as node degree distribution.

![Distribuzione rete prefentialG p = 0.40](../plots/loglog_preferentialG_0.4.jpg)

These experimental results reflect the theoretical analysis previously carried out. In addition, the degree mean and std
are completely different from the network in exam, the networks generated are not connected,so the diameter can not be evaluated,
and the node degree distributions follow a power law. All these differences make it possible to exclude this model.
